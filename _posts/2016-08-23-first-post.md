I'm writing this post because I'm happy to see this site up but hate to
see it empty. It looks fucking ugly when it's empty.

Writing is fucking awkward.

I can do this...

{% highlight bash %}
git reset --soft HEAD~1
...edit shit
git push -f origin master
{% endhighlight %}

I can un-awkward, awkward shit I've written.

Just like this post.

But I won't.

Because I think it's brilliant...

Brilliantly awkward.
